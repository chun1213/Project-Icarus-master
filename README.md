<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
I do not claim ownership of the music or the sprites used or the libraries packed in here

The Devourer of God sprite used is from the Calamity mod for Terraria found [here](https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/calamity-mod.44065/)  
The Music used in this game is also from the Calamity mod, the artist's youtube channel is [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/SUPEREMERALD123)  
The rest of the weapon textures and backgrounds as well as Icarus boss sprite were found online and I do not own.

<h2> Installation: </h2>
Heres the JAR File for the game: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zL_eT-qvrXpXBQNvVVWBvXP6KU_p_V4A/view?usp=sharing
If you have trouble running it by double click, it is probably a java out of memory error, 
Try running the game using command line by typeing:"java -Xmx1300M -jar game.jar" when navagated to the folder the jar file is located.
This will increase the Heap size of the Java VM
 

<h2> Cheats: </h2>
Most of the Commands are in the game's control section but here are some debug commands:

infinite money: press "p" no caps in the inventory menu 

infinite health: press "p" no caps while in the game 

<h1>Gameplay:</h1>

<h2>Inventory:</h2>
My main focus in the making of this game was to create an inventory system inside the game where you can obtain and equip different weapons, In the end, there was over 30 total weapons + equipment implemented, each having a unique stat and or passive/active ability as well as description.

</p>

You can see the tooltips which pop up when you hover over an item here and your currently equiped items + stats aswell.
You items are obtained by random chance through the lottery system in the bottom right using coins which you receive after each playthrough based on score.

<h2> Enemies</h2>
<b> Spoilers Ahead!</b>

There are 3 different basic enemy types, they do not have sprites but they each have a unique attack pattern and AI

</p>

1. The enemy in the top left is the gunner, he will attack you from range using a burst of 3 shots of low damage. He will run if you aproach him.
2. The fat enemy with the mace is the heavy, he will attack you with a mace to do massive damage but with a large windup, he has a large healthpool and cannot be stunned.
3. The regular sized enemy with the sword is just a fighter, he will aproach you and swing his fast sword to do medium damage.

<h2> Bosses</h2>
These enemies have massive healthpools and many different attacks which they can use. They also have moving sprites.

<b>Icarus:</b>

Despite being in the name of the game, he is only the first boss, he is agile and forces you to use your dashes or blocks. He randomly chooses between 4 possible attacks.
He will apear once the 2000 point threshold is reached.

<b>Devourer of Gods:</b>

Named after a similar boss in a mod for terraria called Calamity, he is only the final boss, he is agile and forces you to use your dashes. His head does massive damage and he will attempt to encircle the player. Be careful! he likes to trick the player.
He will apear once the 10000 point threshold is reached.
