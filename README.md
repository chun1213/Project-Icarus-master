 A quick game I made in processing in eclipse, Am currently updating the readme with more info
Heres the JAR File for the game: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zL_eT-qvrXpXBQNvVVWBvXP6KU_p_V4A/view?usp=sharing
If you have trouble running it by double click, it is probably a java out of memory error, 
Try running the game usign command line by typeing:"java -Xmx1300M -jar game.jar" when in the folder the jar file is located.
This will increase the Heap size of the Java VM
