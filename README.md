 A quick game I made with the processing library in eclipse,
Heres the JAR File for the game: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zL_eT-qvrXpXBQNvVVWBvXP6KU_p_V4A/view?usp=sharing
If you have trouble running it by double click, it is probably a java out of memory error, 
Try running the game using command line by typeing:"java -Xmx1300M -jar game.jar" when navagated to the folder the jar file is located.
This will increase the Heap size of the Java VM


Most of the Commands are in the game's control section but here are some debug commands:
infinite money: press "p" no caps in the inventory menu
infinite health: press "p" no caps while in the game

If you wish to see the bosses, please get to 2000 points and 10000 points and then defeat all the enemies.
